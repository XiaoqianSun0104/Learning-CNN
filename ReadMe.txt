This repository contains all python code when self-learning CNN.
  
  1.Intro to CNN: A brief introduction of CNN. Sometimes you will feel confusing when you get to know new models, but you can always get a clear clue when you look back.
  
  2.Regularization: Just start. A introduction of all over-fitting regularizartion methods. In dropout part, there is a CNN model using tensorflow.
  
  3.Activation Function: Just start. Introduce differnet activatio function.
  
  4.Transfer Learning: Just start. Learn the power of transfer learning, and save time and cost when you want to train a model next time. I also want to try ResNet using transfer learning. And the most popular object tracking model, mask R_CNN, also used transfer learning.  

Hope I can keep updating this repository.
